	- puppet does support llm related physical animations; would be nice to turn this back on
	- try a smaller mobile friendly llm so that this can run on a phone
	- puppet-class is overkill; it could just be a javascript object
	- global pub/sub is probably overkill; should show how to wire events more directly
