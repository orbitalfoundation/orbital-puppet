	- puppet does support llm related physical animations; would be nice to turn this back on
	- global pub/sub is way overkill; must wire events more directly to each other to reduce traffic

	- on mobile vob and stt crash (detect and switch to built in voice)
	- on mobile audio echo cancellation fails in general
	- on mobile the local llm is crushed flat (replace with a static non llm simple thinker)
	- on mobile tts/diarization also crushing the system (replace with built in voice)

	- write a tts-sys module that uses built in voice; this would help mobile not fall over

	- why isn't the initial 'all systems nominal' animating the puppet mouth?
	- change icons for consistency
	- do that mobile mode thing
