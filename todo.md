	- ux
		- status bar - used to have a status bar that reported on various status events - this could be re-introduced

	- puppet
		- puppet gaze is supported and should be turned back on for a more powerful interaction
		- puppet does support llm related physical animations; would be nice to turn this back on

	- code improvements 
		- puppet-class is overkill; it could just be a javascript object
		- rickys vad (voice activity detector) has been revised and a new version should be used
		- global pub/sub is probably overkill; should show how to wire events more directly
		- creating a pub/sub group would be another option as well
