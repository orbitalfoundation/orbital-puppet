	- text overflow is annoying

	- still noticing some older traffic get past the barge in interrupt detector

	- noticed a final sentence not make it through once

	- make microphone off really work

	- if barge in is disabled then voice interruption should not be permitted to get past the chat system

	- if submit on completion is disabled then full sentences should not be able to get past chat system


	- puppet
		- puppet gaze is supported and should be turned back on for a more powerful interaction
		- puppet does support llm related physical animations; would be nice to turn this back on
		- try a smaller mobile friendly llm so that this can run on a phone

	- code improvements 
		- puppet-class is overkill; it could just be a javascript object
		- rickys vad (voice activity detector) has been revised and a new version should be used
		- global pub/sub is probably overkill; should show how to wire events more directly
		- creating a pub/sub group would be another option as well
